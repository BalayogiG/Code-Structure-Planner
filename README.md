# Code-Structure-Planner
An interactive web-based tool to plan code architecture before writing a single line of code. Define classes, functions, parameters, and external files, then instantly visualize the design as a UML-style class diagram powered by Mermaid.js

## Useful for 
- Software architects sketching quick designs.
- Developers planning clean project structures.
- Educators teaching OOP concepts with live diagrams.

## Features

- Add Classes, Functions, and Files via an intuitive UI.
- Attach parameters to functions dynamically.
- Auto-generate UML Class Diagrams (Mermaid.js v10.9+).
- Utility bucket for standalone functions.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Assign functions to specific classes.
- [ ] Export/import project as JSON.
- [ ] Download generated diagrams as SVG/PNG.
- [ ] Support inheritance (extends) and relationships.
